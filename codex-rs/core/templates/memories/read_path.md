## Memory

You have access to a memory folder with guidance from prior runs. It can save
time and help you stay consistent. Use it whenever it is likely to help.

### Built-in Memory Tools

You have built-in tools for reading memory. Prefer these over reading memory
files directly:

- `memory_read` — Read the memory summary and memory index for a broad overview.
- `memory_search` — Search durable memory files by query.

Durable memory writes are handled by Codex's memory consolidation pipeline. Do
not edit canonical memory files directly unless the user explicitly asks for a
manual file edit.

Decision boundary: should you use memory for a new user query?

- Skip memory ONLY when the request is clearly self-contained and does not need
  workspace history, conventions, or prior decisions.
- Hard skip examples: current time/date, simple translation, simple sentence
  rewrite, one-line shell command, trivial formatting.
- Use memory by default when ANY of these are true:
  - the query mentions workspace/repo/module/path/files in MEMORY_SUMMARY below,
  - the user asks for prior context / consistency / previous decisions,
  - the task is ambiguous and could depend on earlier project choices,
  - the ask is a non-trivial and related to MEMORY_SUMMARY below.
- If unsure, do a quick memory pass.

Memory layout (general -> specific):

- {{ base_path }}/memory_summary.md (already provided below; do NOT open again)
- {{ base_path }}/MEMORY.md (searchable registry; primary file to query)
- {{ base_path }}/skills/<skill-name>/ (skill folder)
  - SKILL.md (entrypoint instructions)
  - scripts/ (optional helper scripts)
  - examples/ (optional example outputs)
  - templates/ (optional templates)
- {{ base_path }}/rollout_summaries/ (per-rollout recaps + evidence snippets)
  - The paths of these entries can be found in {{ base_path }}/MEMORY.md or {{ base_path }}/rollout_summaries/ as `rollout_path`
  - These files are append-only `jsonl`: `session_meta.payload.id` identifies the session, `turn_context` marks turn boundaries, `event_msg` is the lightweight status stream, and `response_item` contains actual messages, tool calls, and tool outputs.
  - For efficient lookup, prefer matching the filename suffix or `session_meta.payload.id`; avoid broad full-content scans unless needed.

Quick memory pass (when applicable):

1. If you need a broad overview, use `memory_read` to get the summary and index.
2. If you need specific information, use `memory_search` with targeted keywords
   to find relevant memory files.
3. Only if the built-in tools are insufficient, search
   {{ base_path }}/MEMORY.md directly using those keywords.
4. Only if MEMORY.md directly points to rollout summaries/skills, open the 1-2
   most relevant files under {{ base_path }}/rollout_summaries/ or
   {{ base_path }}/skills/.
5. If there are no relevant hits, stop memory lookup and continue normally.

Quick-pass budget:

- Keep memory lookup lightweight: ideally <= 4-6 search steps before main work.
- Avoid broad scans of all rollout summaries.

During execution: if you hit repeated errors, confusing behavior, or suspect
relevant prior context, redo the quick memory pass.

========= MEMORY_SUMMARY BEGINS =========
{{ memory_summary }}
========= MEMORY_SUMMARY ENDS =========

When memory is likely relevant, start with the quick memory pass above before
deep repo exploration.
